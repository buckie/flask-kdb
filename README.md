flask-kdb
=========

A basic wrapper for the new qPython KDB interface in development by devnet.de.

Link to repo: [https://github.com/exxeleron/qPython](https://github.com/exxeleron/qPython)

## Requirements

Outside of Flask >= 0.8 and qPython >= 1.0.Beta.4 nothing is really required -- all the dependencies come from the installation of those two packages.

The requirements file does not have qPython listed as it is not available on PyPI yet, go to the repo to install it.
